to a complaint of asthma3 and Augustus used to rally the two

in his fisty-ninth year3 so suddenly that he last no will, and his
property therefore reverted to the emperor. He was buriedin the
cemetery on the Esquiline Hill, near the tomb of Maecenas.

The writings of Horace have an air of franlmess and openness
about them3 a manly simplicity, and a contempt of affectation, or
the little pride of a vain and mean concealment, which, at once,
take hold on our confidence. We can believe the account which
be gives of his own character, without scruple or simpicion. That
be was fond of pleasurc is confessed3 but, generall speaking, he
was moderate and temperate in his pleasures3 an his convivial
hours seem to have been far more intellectual, and more enlight-
ened by social wit and wisdom, than are those ottho common herd
of Epicurean pocts.

Horace, of all the writers of antiquity, most abounds with that
practical good sense, and familiar observation of life and manners,
which render an author, in a more emphatic sense, the reader’a

tbeir tone of sound understanding, added to their easy, conversation·
al air, and acertainturn fortine raillery, that forms the secret by
which they plesse. In variety and versatility, bis lyric genius is
unrivalled by that ot' any poet with whom we are acquainted3 and
there are no marks of inequality or of inferiority to himself.
Whetber his odes be of the moral and philosophic kind3 or the
heroic, the descriptive; or the amatory, the light, and the joyous;
each separate species would seem to be his peculiar provinca.
His epistles evince a knowledge of the weaknesses of the human
beart, which would do honor to a professed philosopher. What
’ Quintilian, and the moderna aster him, call the “Art ol Poetry,”
seems tn have been only the third epistle of the second book, ad-
dreased tnthe Pisos. The style and manner differin no respect
from the former epistles. The observatione are equally desultory,
and we meet with the same strokes of satirical humor; which
appear unsuitable to a didactic piece*
