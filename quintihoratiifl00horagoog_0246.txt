This ode is aa expression of friendship to Septimius, a Roman
knight cf high standing. He was a poet and a soldier. He had

. together in toils and dangers, he now wishes to retire with him,
and to spond the evening os life in tranquillity, either at his own
seat ut Tibur, or with Septimius at Tarentum.

ODE V.

There has been some doubt who the Pompey here addressed
was, some suppose it to have been Pompeius Varus. But it is
pretty generally believed that the address is to Pompeius Grosphus
Hc was an early friend and companion ofour poet, and was with him
at the battle of Philippi. He also continued in opposition to Au-
gustus afterwards. But when the peace was concluded between
Sextus Pompey and the Triumvirate, ageneral amnesty was grant·
ed to all Pompey’s party. Grosphus, taking advantage of this, re-
turned to his friends3 on which occasion Horace addressed this
ode to him, hy way of congratulation, which naturally turne ou
their common dangers and sufferings in former days.
