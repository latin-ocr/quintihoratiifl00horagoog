ODE XVII.

Horace here predicts the glory and immortality of his name.
And, with the true spirit of a poet, he imagines himself already as-
suming the form and faculties of a swan, and soaring above the
earth, over which he is about to tolie his aeria] flight. Aa he will
leave the humble abodes cimon, so he will shake off “ this morta]
coil,” and cease to be an object of human sympathy or sorrow.
He wishes not for the empty honora of a burial, nor the waste of
useless tears on hia account, since he shall not die.
