NOTES.

ODE XVII.

Phidyle was a rustic woman, and, as most commentatore sup·
pose, the poet’s house-kocpcr in the country. She seems to have
imbibed the opinion that sacrifices to the gods were more or less
acceptable in proportion to their intrinsic value. Horace in dtis
ode attempts to convince her, that the gods regarded the disposi-
tion of mind with which sacrifices wore offered, rather than the
· costlincss of the gills3 that purity of life and good intentioris were
of most importance3 and that with these, any offerings, however
small, were acceptable.

1. Supinas: when the ancients prayed to th'e celestial gods,
they raised their hands ‘with the palma upwardsz’ but turned
them downwards when they addressed the infernal gods.

2. Noscente Ιιιιηᾶε the occasions were very numerous on which
it was supposed proper to make sacrifices to the gods; Horace
would imply that once a month‚ ‘at the new moon,’ was sufficient,
and then it was not necessary to be extravagant-

is, that these victims are designed sor public sacrifices, which muy
with propriety be more magnificent than those ofprivate individu-
. tals, who ought to make their offerings proportionate to their stu·
tion and ubilities.

with rosemary end tender myrtlc! This is enough. You need
not attempt to appense them by the slaughter os many victims.

In this ode Horace invcighs against luxury and extravaganca
us the prcvoiling vices of the age. The ode may be considered
as consisting of three parts. ln the first, the 1poet exposes the
licentious enonuities of the agc; in the secon ‚ he shows their
causes ; and in the third, points out their proper remedies.
