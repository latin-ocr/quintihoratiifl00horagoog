in his fisty-ninth year3 so suddenly that he 1011110 will, and his
property therefore reverted 10 the emperor. He was buried in the
cemetery on the Esquiline Hill, near the tomb 01 Maecenas.

The writings 01 Horace have an nir 01 franlnress and openness
about them 3 a manly simplicity, and a contempt 01 affectation, or
the little pride 01 0 vain and mean concealment, which, at once,
take hold on our confidence. We can believe the account which
he gives 01 his own character, without scruple or suspicion. That
he was fond 01 pleasure is confessed3 but, general] speaking, he
was moderate and temperate in his pleasures3 011 his convivial
hours seem 10 have been 101 111010 intellecturi, and more enlight-
ened by social wit and wisdom, than are those 011110 common herd
01 Epicurean poete. ¹

Horace, 01011 the writers 01 antiquity, most abounds with that
practicai good sense, and familiar observation 011110 and manners,
which render an author, in a more emphatic sense, the reader’s
companion. Good sense, in fact, seems the most distinguishing
10011110 01 his satires3 for his wit seems rather forced5 and it is
their tone 01 sound understandiag, added to their easy, conversation-
nl air, and a certain turn for fine raillery, that forms the secret by ¹
which they plesse. In variety aad versatility, his lyric genius is
unrivalled by that of any poet with whom we 010 acquainted3 and
there are no marks 01 inequality or 01 inferiority to himself.
Whether his odes be 01 the moral and philosophie kind3 or the
heroic3 the descriptive3 01 the amatory, the light, aad the joyous3
each separate species would seem to be his peculiar province.
Hie epistles evince aknowledge 01 the weaknesses of the human
heart, which would do honor to a professed philosopher. What
· Quintilian, 01111110 moderas aher him, 0011 the “Art 01 Poetry,”
seems to have been only the third epistle 01 the second book, ad-
dressed to the Pisos. The style and manner differin 110 respect
from the former epistles. The observatione 010 equally desultory,
and we meet with the same strokee 01 satirical humor3 which
appear unsuitable to a didactic piace*
