ODE ΙΙ.

Caius Crispus Sallust, to whom this ode is addressed, was the
son of the sister of the distinguished historiari of the same name.
He was a gentleman of equestrian rank and splendid fortune. He
stood high at court, being a particular favorite of Augustus. But

neither his rank nor his fortune. ,

The poet intends to complirnent him on the liberal and noble
use he made of his fortune and his opportunity of diffusing happi-
ness3 and shows that a proper use of riches is the only way to
make them a blessing.
