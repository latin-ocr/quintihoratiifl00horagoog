ODE VII.

Licinius Varro Murena, the brother of Proculeius Varro Mure·
na, mentioned in Ode II. 5. of this Book, for his parental affection
and generosity towards his brothers, was ayoung man ofa restless,
ardent, and ambitious spirit Horace, lmowing his character, and
wishing to preserve him from the evils to which his fearless and
aspiring views exposed him, addressed this ode to him, contain-
ing much sound wisdom, and some excellent rules and maxims for
life. But Licinius could not be governed by thena Having been
detectedin forming a conspiracy against Augustae, he suffered

ODE VIII.

Quinctius Hirpinus was a man of great werith, and of an anx-
ious and timid character. He made himself uuhappy by dreading
changes and civil commetiens, which might endanger his posses-
sions. Horace offers to him, in this beautiful ode, the same kind
of consolation which he frequently gives to others in trouble. He
exhorta them not to be anxious about suturity3 since life is too
short to have any portion of it wasted in anavailing anxieties. Old
age and infirmities will soon deprive thern of the power of enjoy-
ing the blessings they possess. He recommendo, therefore, that
they should make the most of present enjoyments, without troub-
ling their thoughts about the things beyond their resch or con·
tro.
