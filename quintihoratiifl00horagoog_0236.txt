ODES. BOOK 1.

ODE XXII.

Mr. Sanadon says, that Horace was at an entertainment where
a dispute began to inflame some os the company already heated
with wine. Instead of attempting to restore peace by grave ad-
vice and sober reasoning, he gayly proposed to drown all disputes
in a bumper3 which having succeeded, he wrote a few lines on
the occasion.

5. Vino et lacernis . .. discrepat: ‘how strangely abhorrent is
the Persian sword from wine and candles τ’ i. e. the festive board;
for the Romans usually had their entertainments by candia-light.

8. caleo . . . presso: this alludes to the custom os reclining at
table with the lest elbow resting on a conch.

ODE XXIII.

The occasion of this ode is not known3 although ithae been the

subject of various conjectures. Itis a dialogue‚ represented aa
having tehen place between a mariner and the shade of Archytas,
a celebrated mathematician and philosopher oi Tarentum.

Archytas had been shipwrecked on the coast of Apulia3 and
the poet represents a manner, who had accidentally found his
body driven ashore by the waves, as thus exclaiming: ‘And could
not you escape death, Archytas! How amella space you cover,
who could measure the heavens‚ the earth, andthe seal' The ad·
dress of the mariner occupies the first six verses3 and the reply
continues through the ode.

1. Te marie munero: the construction is, Archyta, perna
munero exigui pulveris cohibentia, mensorem ommi et terrae arcnae-
quicaddhnilririiiim‘eid'cdid'gec'diiiihiillm l(liiiiirirentntors differ as to the
meaning of this word. Bentley and Doering consider it as here

. ι . a . . .
tlttaltatt‘ltl llllllrllttllrtrtltlllltattat
the wide extended ocean, and the land. But Dacier, Gesner, and
others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of a little
dust to cover your body dalaias you from the Elysian fields 3’ allu-
ding to the prevailing belief that the sou] could not pass the Styx
under a hundred years, if the body were not buried To diis, ref-
erence is made at the conclusion of the ode, where the mariner is
entreated to render this little service, of throwing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the sonl.

7. Occidit: The shade of Archytas here replies to this effect:
‘Do not be surprised, mariner, that l have shared the common lot
of humanity3 for Tantalus died, though he was admitted to the
society of the gpgs3 and Tithonus, Pythagoras? &c Archytas
