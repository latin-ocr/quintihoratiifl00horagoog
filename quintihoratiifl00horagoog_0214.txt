ΤΟ THE METRES 11st BY HORACR·
· -φ-

Horace uses twenty different kinds of Measure, or varis-
ties of Metre. These are combined in sistam different ways,
forming, ofoourse, sixteen different Strophes, or Stanzas! In
ordor to know to which ol‘ these oombinations any ode be· ”
longs, we have only to find the first words of that ode in the
following Alphahetioal Index ; and against them is plaoed the
number os the combination to whioh it belongs, and aooording
to whioh it may be scanned. For instanoe3 suppose it were
desired to know the kind os verse contained in tho First Ode
os the First Book3 look in the Alphahetioal Index on the next
page, and lind there the first words, Maecenas atenim and
against them stands v11. No. VII, then, ofthe Comhinations
on page 198, informs you that the verse is Asclepiadem and
shows you how it may he soanned. In the same way the
method ol‘ soanning every ode in Horaoe may be known, by
finding the first words ol‘ it in the Index, and referring to the
number against it, in tlre Combinations.

*A strophe, οι· stenen, includes aa many lines as are necessary to
show all tho different kinds ol measure in an ode. 1t ls oalled strophe,
which, in Greek, literally means o turning,because, al the end ollt, you
turn back to the same kind ol verse with which you began.
