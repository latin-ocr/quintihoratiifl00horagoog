ODE V.

This ode seems to heve been written in honor of Augusbrs. It
sets forth his achievements, and represents him 'as the guardian
god of the Roman people. ’

l. Coelo regnare: ‘we have been accustomed to believe
that Jove reigns in heaven from hearing him thunder there!

2. Praescna dicun.- ‘a god upon earth :’ i. e. so Augustus, byhis
conquests and his services to his country, shall be hailed as a visi-
ble divinity. Preoena has this signification, and not propitius, sa-
vena, as some have supposed. , -

4. Persis.- it is said that Phraates, king of the Parthians, aster ”
being restored to his throne, was so alarmed merely at the report ›
that Augustus was about to make war upon him, that he volunta·
rily sent an embassy to him, and offered to restore the military

standards that had been lost several years before at the defeat of Ι

Crassus. The Parthians are here meant by Persis. Augustus
did notin reality subdue either the Britons or Parthians, but the
ffilzsrlrllgrtgitted to the authority of his name. Sea Book 1. Ode
