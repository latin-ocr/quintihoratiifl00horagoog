BOOK 11.

EPISTLE 1.

Ausuarus had complained that Horace had not addressed any

ofhie satires or epistles to him. Iu this beautiful and finisbed
epistle the poet makes ample amends for his former remissness.
In the first pert of it he examines the comparisou between the
ancients and the moderns, which has been mutter of dispute in
ull ages. He next shows the folly of that excessive love of un-
tiquity, which regarded the time of any performance rather than
its merita. In the third place hc treats of the theutre, and os the
difficulty of succeeding there. And finally he would remiud
princes how important it is sor thern to encourage aspirit of emu-
latliolr: fordepic poetry, by which their own aohrevements may bc
cee rate.

10. i.- Hercules slew the hydra of Lerna.

13. nec.- for orti es: one eminent iu any department de· ·
presses, by his same, those who are inferior to him.

23. stc fautor ueterum: the ideu is,So extravagantly do the
people admire the works of antiquity, that they would say, the
Muses themselves altered, on Mount Alba, the luws of the
Twelve Tables, the treaty with the Gabii, duc. These were
gmong tlge filit proditrlcfions of the {omens and certainly not to
econsr ere asinoe m composr on.

28. ‚Si quio . . . hqoomur: uf, because the most ancient
works of the Greeks ore the best, we are to weigh Roman
fflm’in the same balance, it is in vain to say any thing

er.
