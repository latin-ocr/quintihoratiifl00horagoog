ODE Vll.

A festival was observed with much religione pomp by the Ro·
111011 ladies on the first of March, in memory 01 the day on which
the Sabine women reconciled and made peace between the Sa·
bines and their husbands, who had seized them. On this day, too,
they bad dedicated a temple 10 J uno, in which they annualty 01-
fered sacrifices 1ο that goddess. While the ladies 11010 engaged
in their offerings 10 lunc, their husbands sacrificed tolenus. Af-
ter these religioas services were over, the ladies received pres-
ents 110111 their husbands and other friends, as an acknowledg·
ment 01 the favor conferred by their happy mediation. The Ca·
lends 01 March were called Matronclia, cr Matronales Fato.

We may suppose that Maecenas, in a visit to the poet early on
ibe Calends 01 March, had expressed some surprise 01 finding him

employed in Preffirssti‘ms for a domestic feast, as Horace was 1101
