SATIRE IV.

This satire consiste of an amusing dialogus between the poet
and one Catius, who pretends to be a great philosopher, and also
to be profoundly wersed in the sciencc of coolrery. But he be-
comes ridiculous by attaching so much importance to what ir of
little consequenoe; and more particularly by exposing his atter
ignorance of the subject on which he discourses. The whole is
a keen satire upon that class of men who place their supreme
happiness in the pleasures ol' the table. This he considers an
ablufse lpl'sElpicureanisru, in the refined forms of which he was hirn-
se a erever.
