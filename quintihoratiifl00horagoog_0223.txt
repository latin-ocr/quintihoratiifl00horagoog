In the first part of this ode the poet describes the joy and beau· ·

ODE V.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was a distinguished general, and so
much esbeemed by Augustus, that he gave him his daughter J ulia
.in marriage. Agrippa wished his achievements to be celebrated
l by Horace, who, while he excuses himself from the mora laboribus
and responsible task of writing a formal poem, ingeniously pays
him the most flattering oomplimeut He intimatas that Agrippa ’s
martial glory deserves the strains of a lostier genius than his own3
that his was the lyric muse, and fit only for light or tn'fling sub-
jects ; but that Varius, gisted with the sublimest inspirations of the
epic muse, would sing his praises in strains worthy of the subject.

Most commentatore have thought this ode merely au excuse οι
Horace for not doing that which he had no disposition to do. But
the fulness of the praises bestowed rendere this conjecture super·
flaons. lt is probably only an instance, among many, of his milri·
ly persor-ming what he pretends to decline doing
