ODE VI.

L. Munatius Plancus, a gentleman of fortune and of consular
dignit ,had joined the republican party with Brutus and Cassius3
but er the defeat of bis party at Phrlippi, he joined Augustus.
He was cordially received, and treated with great respect by Au-

stus ; but being afterwards induced by the friends of Antony to
bdlieve, tbat, with the aid of Cleopatra, the republicans might still
be successful, he went over to Antony. He found, however, that
things were less favorable than they had been represented, and
returned again to the ruling party. Aster this he was not very
cordially received by Augustus. And feeling that he did not stand
well at court, he retired to his country seat at Tibur. Here, prob-
abl under some apprehensions for bis safety, Plancus became
medancholy and unhappy. Horace,his friend, writes this ode to
him; offering such reasons as his ingenuity su gested, to induce
him to abendon his ill bodings, and become cheerful. A sociul
hilam vluith did old friends, he says, will do much towards removing
