Rome and Athens. Alter enjoying the best means of in·
struction that Rome afforded, at the age of about twenty-one, Hor·
ace was sent to Athens to complete his educatiou. Whilst Horace
was at Athens, Cesar was assassinated3 and Brutus and Cassius
repaired to that city, in order te enlist in t'he cause of freedom the
young Romans who were pursuing their studies there. Horace
attached himself to Brutus, under ¹whom'hc scrved nearly two

but obtained a pardon, and afterwards was distinguished by the
favor and friendship of Mecenas. He filled the office of a clerk
tn the trcasury, and assisted the emperor as bis private arnanuen-
sis. This appears from the fragment of a letter from Augustus lo
his minister. “I used to bc equal to the writing ofmy own letters,
but 1 am now so pressed with a multiplicity of business, and so in-
firm, that I wish you to bring me our friend Horace. Lat him come,
then, and leave that parasitical table for my palace, and assist me
iu writing my letters.” Another fragment of u letter from Augus-
tus to Horace, is expressed in terms of the most easy and playful
familiarity. “Dionysius has conveyed your little volume to me3
which, uotto quarrel with its brevity, l take in good part. But
you seem to me fearful, lest your works should be bigger than
ourself. However, what ou wantinheightis made up to you
{y that little round body of yours. You should, therefore, write
such a roll, as may go, not round a atich, but a quart measure3
and then the circumfereuce of your volume may be squab and
swollen‚ like the rotundity of your little belly.” This is a pleasing
rsonal trait. Horace has, himself, given us some interesting
'nts of his person and manners. He was gray before his time3
fond ofbasking in the sun3 and of taking a mesto on the bank of
a river. He speaks of breaking stoncs and turning up the ground,
when in the country3 and when in town, of saunteringin the mar-
ket, or riding out on a doch-tailed mule, which he sat awkwardly.
