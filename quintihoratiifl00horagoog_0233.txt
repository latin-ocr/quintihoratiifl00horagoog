ODE XVII.

It seems that Meuanas had intimated to Horace 1113 intention os
making him n visitat his counuyaeat at Tibur, in the Sabine ter·
ritory, about twenty or twenty-five miles from Rome.

The poet intends to give hia illustrious friend awclcome to his
house, but, to prevent any disappointment in one accrrstomed to the
choice wines and other luxuries of the court at Rome, be tells him
he will find but plain fare. ’

1. Vile. . . Sabinum.- ‘cheap Sabine wine.’

2. Graecd . . . plancas.- ‘which Ι sealed in a Grecian jar the
very day on which you received such applause in the theatra!
—Tartdr the Romans, when most careful to preserve their wine,
ond to correct its crudity, put it into carthan jars, which were at
first imported from Graece-Levi.- fiam lino3 when the jars were
filled, they were scaled or closed up with pitch orwax. Although
the Sabine wine was by no means worthy of so much care and ex·
pense, yet, as on the occasion referred to, Mecenas, on making
hia appearance attha theatre 131 the first time atter a severe ill- .

ancestors of ecenas dwelt.

9. Praelo . .. Caleno.- ‘by a Calenian wine-presa? The best
presses were made at Cales. The sense seems to be this3 ‘You
will drink the choica Caecubian wine, ethome if you plenae, or
where itis to be had; but Ι have neither Falemian nor Formian

wine! Some suppose this to be ahint for Maecenas to bring some
wine with him, better than was tn be found at Tibur. ·

ODE XVIII.

This is a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to Apollo and Diana,
to be sung by a choir of twenty-seven young men, and another
choir os the same number of young virgins, on a day consecrated
to the worship ο1 these tutelary divinities. The poet seems to
taplre the part of a priest of Apollo, and n) dictate to each choir
wnmm.

hortcd to sing the presses of Apollo. ,
