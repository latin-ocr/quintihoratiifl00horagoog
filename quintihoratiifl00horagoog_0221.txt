‘ect in assuming it was tn avenge the death os Cesar, aud to l'rec
ome from the calamities under which it was suffering.

The poet therefore avails himself of these incidents to address
Augustus, as the tutelary divinity ofRome3 and, aher compliment·
ing him very delicatsly under the character of Merc , exhorta
him to cherish the blessings of peace at home, and to efend tho
Roman people from foreign foes.

6. Secutum Pyrrha: Pyrrha was tho wife of Deucalion, king
ol Thessaly, iu whose time the deluge came. Pyrrha may well
be thought to have complained of ‘strange prodigies,’ whichstlse
Romans were apprehensive were about to be renewed.

13. Flauum . . . uadis: Our word ‘yellow‘ but poorly expresses
the meaning of flauas, when applied to the Tiber at, or near to
Rome. This river is there deep, rapid, aud exceedingly turbid,

' from the quantities of saud and loam usually blended with its wa·

ter, especially aster rains, which give it a tawny or muddy color,
its appearance is extremely unpoetic, and anything but‘ysllow.’
About the first of January, 1830, the Tiber rose fourteen feet in
twenty-fourhours3 and when it subsided, the alluvial deposits along
the stone steps of the quay in Rome were from six to eight inches
deep. The predominant color of these depositswas nearl thatof
bulfdricd cloy‚· aud this is the prevailing color of the *iiber at
Rome—Rctorh's: ‘being driven baclc’ The Tiber flows into the
Tuscan sea, but in this instance, being driven up by ariolanttem-
pest against its current, already swollen by rains and snow, it

15. Monumenta regia.- i. e. the monument os Numa Pompilius. ’

17. itta.- the construction is, dum amuis marius jactat nia,
nimium pereni, sc fore ultorem necis Carsaris et ungria utun ⁸
mabbo, Joocnonprobautc. Ilia, called also Rhea Silvia, was a
mother of Romulus. She was thrown by Amulius into the Tiber,
or rather into the Anio, near where it empties into the Tiber, which
is therefore called her husband, and made to avenge her wro
Ilia may be said to have carried her complaints concaming e
death of Caesar too far3 since they brought auch destruction upon
Rome3 which Jupiter, as its tutelary divmity, did not approve.

Doering considers nimium an adjective, agreeing with wmm ,·
“nimium non ad pauent, sed ad ahmam referen um esse putot
nimius enim suit ultor Tiberis, sive modum in ulciscendo uxoris
sura dolore excessit, dum tantam ruinam Romu eductis molieba-
tur.” This certainly appears very consistent.

Rome was chiefly built on the lest or eastern bank ofthe Tiber,
daubo ripa, which, being somewhat lower than the other, was pe·
culiarly exposed to the inundation.

22 Vitio pareatum.- ie. the youth would bc few in number iu
mgheqffmre osshuem civil affin whiffirstgeir {theg eth ed.

they engaged.
