ODE VIII.

It would seem, from the tenor of this ode, that something had
happened to disturb and depress the mind of Thaliarchus3 and
that Horace, to enliven his friend, addressed this ode to him.

Itis highly colored with our poet’s Epicurean principles, and
It enforces his favorite doctrine, that man should not trouble
himself about futurity‚ and that all he has to do is to make the most
of present enjoyments‚ and to leave the rest to the gods.

Some have supposed Thaliarchus to be a fictitious name; and
that the whole is an imitation of an ode of Aloeus.

winter of 1829-30,1 observedthat the Apennines were white with
snow at times when Soracte was free from it May not the circum·
stance of this mountain being covered with deep snow be alluded
to by our poet to imply that the winter was unusually severe?
