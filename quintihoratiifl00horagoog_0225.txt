Ι, 12. Dornur mace recreantis.- various have been the conjec-

ᾗ tures as to the meaning of these words. There was at Tibur,
now Tlooli, a wood‚ and near it a small lake or fouutain, each called
Albunea, from a Sibyl of that name, whose temple sn'll remains al·
most entire on the rock which causes and overhangs the first and
principal fulls of the Anio at Tivoli. Some commentatore suppose ·
the poet speaks of the country-seat of Plancus near this spot, and
some that he refers to a deep cavern in the rock just below the
falls, into which the waters rush with a great noise3 while others
understand him to mean the temple of the Sibyl, who in her re-
sponses isrepresentedasreiichoing the roar of the waterfalls This
temple is certainly a most interesting rain, and it forms at the pres·
ent day one of the most strikingly pictoresque objec'oe in this scene
of unrivalled beauty.

21. Teucer . . ‚s eret: ‘when Teucer fied from his native Sa·
llinis and from his ther? Telamon, king of Salamis, sent his
two sons, Teucer and Ajain to the Trojan war, under an in-
junction that neither should return without his brother. When
Teucer returned, aster the death of Ajax, he was banished by his
father, and went to Cyprus, where he built another Salamis. The
poet here reminds Plancus, that Teucer did not allow himself to
be depressed, although banished from his home aud country ; and
that he, therefore, should call some of bis friends about him, and
regain his elasticity of spirit

29. Amhigncm: i. e. he would build a new Salamis, which
should so rival the old, as to render it doubtful which of them was
spoken of when the name of Salamis should be used.

ODE VII.

worthless character, Horace aws the picture of a youth who has
become the victim of a deep and destructive passion.

2. Sybarin . . . perdere: ‘why are you hastening to destroy Sy-
baris by cherishing his guilty passion?’

Sybaris, a youth of fortune und of ingenuous character, having
yielded to the allurements of sensuality, had abandoned his manly
exereises and his former companions, and was hastening to de·
struction by that fatal infatuation which has led more youths to
perdition than the whole catalogue of other vices.

6. latipulis: the Romans had a kind of curb bits called oerra'

limati, from their resemblance to the uneren. teeth of a wo lu·
