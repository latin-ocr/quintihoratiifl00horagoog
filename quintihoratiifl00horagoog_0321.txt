SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

This satire, written by way of dialogue, is intended to show tha
all mankind are either madmen or fools. Horace had retired in-
to the country during tho Saturnalia. Damasippus, a stoic phi-
Iosopher, pays him a visit, and iu conversation blames hrm for not
waiting and publishing something new, instead of remaining idle,
or retouching his former works. The discourseffly au easy trau-
sition, turns upon Damasippus and his mode of ' e. This leads
to an explanation of the doctrines of the stoice, aud a justification
of their dogmas. The various passione, which tyranniza over the
human hesrt, are portrayed with inimitable skilt The whole
conversation is interspersed with moral reflectione and amful
instruction.
