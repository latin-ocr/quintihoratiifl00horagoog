ODE L

Asinius Ponam, a soldier, a statesman, and a scholar, had also
distinguished himself as a tragic writer3 and had raised the repu-
ration of the Roman stage nearly to an equality with that of Ath-
ens. But Pollio was engaged in a work better deserving his whole
strength and attention. This was a history of the civil wars, in
which he had already advanced considerably‚ when Horace, ap-
prehensive that the applause which Pollio received from the stage
mi ht interrupt a history so interesting to the republic, wrote this
Ο e to urge him to persevere. And at the same time he exhorta
Pollio not to be diverted from this object, he remindshim how deli-
cate and dangerous a task he had undertaken.

1. Motum aa Metello: the construction is, Ο Pollio, tractim dai-
. cum motum es console Metello, causasque belli, dac.

It was during the consulship os Metellus and Lucius Afranius,
that Cesar, Pompey and Crassus formed that confederaoy oom-
monly known by the name of the First Triumvirate. The poet
says, You treat of the civil commotioris which took place, begin·
ning from the consulship of Metellus

3. &comque . . . amicitias: i. e. the coalition of the Mamaea,
so destructive to the liberty of the commonwealth.

6. Periculosa: this might well be called ‘aworkfull ofdanger·
ous chance‚’ since the fidelity of the historiari must he preserved,
without offending Augustus, or disobliging many families that had
been deeply engaged in the civil war, by opening afresh wounds
that were now nearly healed.

9. Maec hogoediae desit thartha: i. e. relinquish for a time our
favorite pursuit, and abstain from writing tragedies, till you dave
put the finishing hand to a work of so much importance as that
in which you are engaged.

10. Mox . . . cathamo: ‘herenhen when you shall have digest·
ed and arranged 'the events in your history, you shall resume tha
noblp employment of writing tragedy with true Athenian dig·
nit .

'ilie cothurnus, or buskin, was frequently put for tragedy, which
had at that time reached a greater degree of excellence at Athens
than at any other place.

From the expression publicas rea ordinarias, many have supposed
Pollio was consul at the time this ode was written, and that this
sentence hod reference to thc management of public business.
