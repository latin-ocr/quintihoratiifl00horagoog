ODE XXX.

Plotius Numida had been three years with Augustus, engaged
in a war in Spain. On his return, he was received with demon-
stratione of joy and thanksgiving by his friend Horace3 who, on
thie happy occasion, assembled the friends of Plotius, and among
them AElius Lamia, a school-follow os Plotius, and dearly beloved
gy him. This celebration was attended with sacrifices, songs, and
auces.

2. Plucura: ‘to propitiare! This word may with propriety be
used, although Plotius had returned in safety3 since hie friends

ODE XXXI.

The death of Cleopatra put an end to the war between Augus
tus aud Antony. This is one of several odes· which Horace wrote
on that occasion. The character and tragical end of Cleopatra
are strikingly represented. Her passione are in violent motion3
her ambitionis intoxication3 her loye ie madness; and her cour·

most splendid and costly kind. The poet here probably meone to
say that it is proper to prepare a lectisternium which was a feast
at which the gods were iovited to attend. and for whom couches
