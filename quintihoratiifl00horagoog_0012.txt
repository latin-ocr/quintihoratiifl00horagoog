The writings of Horace have an air of franlmess and openness
about them ; amanly simplicity, and a contempt ot' affectation, or
the little pride of a vain and mean concealment, which, at once,
take hold on our confidence. We can believe the account which
he gives of his own character, without scruple or suspicion. That
he was fond of pleasure is confessed; but, generall speaking, he
was moderate and temperate in his pleasures3 an his convivial
hours seem ιο have been thr more intellectual, and more enlight-
ened by sociel wit and wisdom, than are those of the common herd
of Epicurean poeta.

Horace, of all the writers of antiquity, most abounds with that
practical good sense, and familiar observation of life and manners,
which render an author, in a more emphatic sense, the reader’s
companion. Good sense, in fact, seems the most distingtrishing
feature of his satires3 t⁴or his wit seems rather forced3 and it is
their tone οι sound understanding, added to their easy, conversation-
al air, and a certain turn for fine raillmy, that forms the secret by
which they please. In variety and versatility‚ his lyric genius is
unrivalled by that of any poet with whom we are acquainted3 and
there are no marks of inequality or of inferiority ιο himself.
Whether his odes be of the moral and philosophic kind3 or the
heroic 3 the descriptiva, or the amatory, the light, aud the joyous3
each separate species would seem to be his peculiar province.
His epistles evince a knowledge of the weaknesses of the human
beart, which would do honor ιο a professed philosopher. What
< Quintilian, and the moderna aster him, call the “Art of Poetry,”
seems to have been only the third epistle ot' the second book, ad·
dressed ιο the Pisos. The style and manner differin no respect
from the former epistles. The observatione are equally desultory,
and we meet with the same strokes of satirical humor, which
appear unsuitable to a didactic piace*
